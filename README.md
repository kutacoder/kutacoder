Hey there, I'm Guy, but on the web I usually go by kutacoder.

I'm a passionately curious autodidact and an enthusiastic problem solver.

My projects range from examples of simple ideas to fully working applications.
They are merely attempts to better understand the techonological world around me, and more importantly, to provide some sort of value - either to myself or (hopefully 🙏🏼) to you.

I believe I can learn from anyone, and I can teach anybody who is willing to learn. After all, as Ernest Hemingway put it:

>  We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.

I try to constantly improve, and to remain true to elegant, succinct, and simple solutions. In the words of Kevlin Henney:

> Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.
