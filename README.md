### Hey, I'm kutacoder, pleased to meet ya!

I'm a passionately curious autodidact and an enthusiastic problem solver.

No matter what the topic in question is, I always try to approach it with an open mind.

All of my projects are attempts to provide some sort of value - either to myself or (hopefully) to you.

I believe I can learn from anyone, and I can teach anybody who is willing to learn.

If you find my projects useful and you have anything to add, please feel free to drop me a line, or even better, open a pull request 🙏🏼.

As Hemingway put it:

>  We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.

I try to constantly improve, and to remain true to simplicty, and elegance.

In the words of Kevlin Henney:

> Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.
